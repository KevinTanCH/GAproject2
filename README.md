# GAproject2 (Japanese Dictionary and Flash card React App)

GA Project 2 Japanese Dictionary and Flash card React App by Kevin

## Japanese Dictionary and Flash card

This is Japanese Dictionary and Flash card React App. I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do for project 2 so I decided to make something that I would use personally. I have completed only the most basic JLPT test (N5) in 2022 December. I do hope to take the higher grade test in the future but it isn't a huge priority.

Main page is a dictionary page and allows you to search the word. Flash Card allows you to test yourself from different word lists. Word list is your own personal word list that you've added.

### Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

- More information like Kanji readings and pitch.
- Darkmode.
